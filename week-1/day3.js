//This week we will be discovering hidden messages by manipulating a given string. Your solutions should account for any non-empty string. On Friday we'll combine our functions to decode a message.

//Yesterday you should have come up with a few specific characters that we'll need today. Let's refer to those as our key characters.

//We need to create a function that will replace any instances of any of the key characters in a given string with an empty space (' '). See below for an example with an example set of key characters.

//Remember to keep your code somewhere safe, as you'll need it to decrypt this week's message!

//COPY
//example key characters -> 'A','_','K','E','Y','!'

//'AyouEcould!thinkKthisAisYhard_toYreadKbeforeYreplacingEthe_keyYcharacters'
//// implement key replacement function
//' you could think this is hard to read before replacing the key characters'

function replaceKeyCharacters(string) {
  const keyCharacters = ["S", "P", "A", "C", "E"];

  for (let e of string) {
    if (keyCharacters.includes(e)) {
      string = string.replace(e, " ");
    }
  }
  return string;
}

replaceKeyCharacters(
  "AyouEcould!thinkKthisAisYhard_toYreadKbeforeYreplacingEthe_keyYcharacters"
